    "A function $derivative(a,b,n)$ takes three input parameters, the two endpoints of the domain $[a,b]$ on which the derivative acts and the number of points $n$ into which that domain is partitioned (yielding $n-1$ intervals), and returns a single two-dimensional numpy array $D$ of dimension $n\\times n$ that represents the finite difference operation. Done correctly, given a discrete function approximation represented by an $n$-dimensional array $f = [f_0, \\ldots, f_{n-1}]$ defined as $f_i = f(x_i)$ on the grid of points $x_i$ from $i=0$ to $i=n$ with fixed spacing $x_{i+1} - x_i = dx$, where $dx = (b-a)/(n-1)$, applying the central difference matrix should yield a new $n$-dimensional array $Df = [(Df)0, \\ldots, (DF){n-1}]$ with interior points: $$(Df)i = \\frac{f{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{2dx}.$$"
